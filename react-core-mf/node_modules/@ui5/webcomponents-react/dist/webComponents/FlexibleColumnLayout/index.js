/**
 * The `FlexibleColumnLayout` implements the list-detail-detail paradigm by displaying up to three pages in separate columns.
 * There are several possible layouts that can be changed either with the component API, or by pressing the arrows, displayed between the columns.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * Use this component for applications that need to display several logical levels of related information side by side (e.g. list of items, item, sub-item, etc.).
 * The Component is flexible in a sense that the application can focus the user's attention on one particular column.
 *
 * ### Responsive Behavior
 *
 * The `FlexibleColumnLayout` automatically displays the maximum possible number of columns based on `layout` property and the window size.
 * The component would display 1 column for window size smaller than 599px, up to two columns between 599px and 1023px,
 * and 3 columns for sizes bigger than 1023px.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * #### Basic Navigation
 *
 * - [Space] / [Enter] or [Return] - If focus is on the layout toggle button (arrow button), once activated, it triggers the associated action (such as expand/collapse the column).
 * - This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
 * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`
