/**
 * The `Badge` is a component which serves
 * the purpose to attract the user attention to some piece
 * of information (state, quantity, condition, etc.).
 * It can contain icon and text information, and its design can be chosen from specific design types.
 *
 * ### Usage Guidelines
 *
 * - If the text is longer than the width of the component, it can wrap, or it can show ellipsis, depending on the `wrappingType` property.
 * - Colors can be semantic or not semantic.
 *
 *
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
