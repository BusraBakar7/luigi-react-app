/**
 * The `Button` component represents a simple push button.
 * It enables users to trigger actions by clicking or tapping the `Button`, or by pressing
 * certain keyboard keys, such as Enter.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * For the `Button` UI, you can define text, icon, or both. You can also specify
 * whether the text or the icon is displayed first.
 *
 * You can choose from a set of predefined types that offer different
 * styling to correspond to the triggered action.
 *
 * You can set the `Button` as enabled or disabled. An enabled
 * `Button` can be pressed by clicking or tapping it. The button changes
 * its style to provide visual feedback to the user that it is pressed or hovered over with
 * the mouse cursor. A disabled `Button` appears inactive and cannot be pressed.
 *
 *
