/**
 * The `Table` component provides a set of sophisticated and convenient functions for responsive table design.
 * It provides a comprehensive set of features for displaying and dealing with vast amounts of data.
 *
 * To render the `Table` properly, the order of the `columns` should match with the
 * order of the item `cells` in the `rows`.
 *
 * Desktop and tablet devices are supported.
 * On tablets, special consideration should be given to the number of visible columns
 * and rows due to the limited performance of some devices.
 *
 * ### Selection
 * To benefit from the selection mechanism of `Table` component, you can use the available selection modes:
 * `SingleSelect` and `MultiSelect`.
 *
 * In additition to the used mode, you can also specify the `TableRow` type choosing between
 * `Active` or `Inactive`.
 *
 * In `SingleSelect` mode, you can select both an `Active` and `Inactive` row via mouse or
 * by pressing the `Space` or `Enter` keys.
 *
 * In `MultiSelect` mode, you can select both an `Active` and `Inactive` row by pressing the
 * `Space` key when a row is on focus or via mouse click over the selection checkbox of the row.
 * In order to select all the available rows at once, you can use the selection checkbox presented in the table's header.
 *
 * **Note:** Currently, when a column is shown as a pop-in, the visual indication for selection is not presented over it.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * #### Fast Navigation
 * This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
 * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`
 *
 * Furthermore, you can interact with `Table` via the following keys.
 *
 * - [F7] - If focus is on an interactive control inside an item, moves focus to the corresponding item.
 * - [Ctrl]+[A] - Selects all items, if MultiSelect mode is enabled.
 * - [Home]/[End] - Focuses the first/last item.
 * - [Page Up]/[Page Down] - Moves focus up/down by page size (20 items by default).
 * - [Alt]+[Down]/[Up] - Switches focus between header, last focused item, and More button (if applies) in either direction.
 * - [Shift]+[Down]/[Up] - Selects the next/previous item in a MultiSelect table, if the current item is selected (Range selection). Otherwise, deselects them (Range deselection).
 * - [Shift]+[Home]/[End] - Range selection to the first/last item of the List.
 * - [Ctrl]+[Home]/[End] - Same behavior as HOME & END.
